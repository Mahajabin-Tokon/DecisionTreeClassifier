# Music Genre Classification Using DecisionTreeClassifier
This project aims to classify music genres using a Decision Tree Classifier model implemented in Python. The project utilizes the scikit-learn library.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage
- Place the music dataset in CSV format (music.csv) in the same directory as the code.
- Execute the code using the following command: python music_classification.py
- The program will split the data into training and testing sets, train the Decision Tree Classifier model and generate predictions on the test data.
- The accuracy of the model will be displayed on the console.
